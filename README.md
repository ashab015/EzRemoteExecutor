# EzRemoteExecutor

A simple to use RemoteExecutor thats actually simple and not a complex pile of shit like WinRM. ✨Magic ✨
Was forced to create this after spending hours fighting with WinRM in intranet VM's.

## Features

- Execute CMD commands remotely via a REST API
- Execute PowerShell commands remotely via a REST API
- Virutally no setup besides opening a port

## Tech

- This is created to be as simple as possible. Just open your ports and run.
- Place this behind a hardware firewall & intranet for security.
